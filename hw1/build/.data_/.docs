[{"title":"Dental care management during the COVID-19 outbreak.","content":["The level of preparedness of the healthcare system plays an important role in management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study attempted to devise a comprehensive protocol regarding dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched until March 2020 for relevant papers. Sixteen English papers were enrolled to answer questions about procedures that are allowed to perform during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients who are in priority to receive dental care services, the conditions and necessities for patient admission, waiting room and operatory room, and personal protective equipment (PPE) that is necessary for dental clinicians and the office staff.","Dental treatment should be limited to patients with urgent or emergency situation. By screening questionnaires for COVID-19, patients are divided into three groups of (a) apparently healthy, (b) suspected for COVID-19, and (c) confirmed for COVID-19. Separate waiting and operating rooms should be assigned to each group of patients to minimize the risk of disease transmission. All groups should be treated with the same protective measures with regard to PPE for the dental clinicians and staff."],"charNum":1202,"wordNum":184,"sentenceNum":8},{"title":"Impact of interleukin-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and antibody responses in patients with COVID-19: A prospective cohort study.","content":["The virological and immunological effects of the immunomodulatory drugs used for COVID-19 remain unknown. We evaluated the impact of interleukin (IL)-6 blockade with tocilizumab on SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and the antibody response in patients with COVID-19.","Prospective cohort study in patients admitted with COVID-19. Serial nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were measured for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG titers, respectively.","138 patients with confirmed infection were included; 76 (55%) underwent IL-6 blockade. Median initial SOFA (p = 0•016) and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p<0•001, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test) were significantly higher among anti-IL-6 users. Patients under IL-6 blockade showed delayed viral clearance in the Kaplan-Meier curves (HR 0•35 [95%CI] [0•15-0•81], log-rank p = 0•014), but an adjusted propensity score matching model did not demonstrate a significant relationship of IL-6 blockade with viral clearance (HR 1•63 [0•35-7•7]). Cox regression showed an inverse association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and the initial viral load (HR 0•35 [0•11-0•89]). Patients under the IL-6 blocker showed shorter median time to seropositivity, higher peak antibody titers, and higher cumulative proportion of seropositivity in the Kaplan Meier curves (HR 3•1 [1•9-5] for S-IgG; and HR 3•0 [1•9-4•9] for N-IgG; log-rank p<0•001 for both). However, no significant differences between groups were found in either S-IgG (HR 1•56 [0•41-6•0]) nor N-IgG (HR 0•96 [0•26-3•5]) responses in an adjusted propensity score analysis.","Our results suggest that in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, IL-6 blockade does not impair the viral specific antibody responses. Although a delayed viral clearance was observed, it was driven by a higher initial viral load. The study supports the safety of this therapy in patients with COVID-19.","Instituto de salud Carlos III (Spain)."],"charNum":1874,"wordNum":300,"sentenceNum":14},{"title":"[Intrauterine growth retardation. Changes in obstetrical practice in France].","content":["The change in practice in connection with fetal growth retardation was studied using two national enquiries on pregnancy and delivery carried out in 1976 and 1981. These showed important changes in practice between the two studies. Although ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring are widely used and are shown as being very important for pregnancies overall, they are not used more often in cases of fetal growth retardation. On the other hand, when they have been started these examinations are more often easily repeated. Recourse to hormonal essay has not changed in intra-uterine growth retardation cases (17%). The percentage of caesareans carried out for retardation rose from 9.4 to 17.4% and these caesarean operations were carried out earlier. 50% of this increase is due to the decision to carry out a caesarean before labour starts. This more aggressive tendency means that the number of premature babies in growth retarded infants was higher in 1981, although the difference not significant and this practice would need further study. There are improvements in neonatal health as a result of the changes although one cannot pinpoint for certain which procedure has caused this improvement."],"charNum":1205,"wordNum":192,"sentenceNum":9},{"title":"Incidence of anxiety in epilepsy during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.","content":["The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people globally, and people with chronic diseases are suffering more in maintaining their mental and physical health.","This cross-sectional, case-control study assessed the anxiety level in people with epilepsy compared with the general population.","The results showed that 13.5% of patients had experienced a severe level of anxiety, but the mean anxiety level between groups did not show significant difference.","Although still many aspects of the pandemic on people with epilepsy are yet to be determined, active investigation of psychological sequels of the pandemic is demanded."],"charNum":639,"wordNum":96,"sentenceNum":4},{"title":"Anesthesiologist age and workforce geography during the United States COVID-19 pandemic.","content":[],"charNum":0,"wordNum":0,"sentenceNum":0},{"title":"Qualitative study of the psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization.","content":["Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread across the globe, but patient experiences are rarely documented.","To explore the psychology of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization.","A phenomenological and robust sampling approach was employed. Sixteen patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology with COVID-19 from 20th January to 1st March 2020 were selected. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, phone calls, or face-to-face interviews using quarantine measures. Data were analyzed using the Colaizzi method.","The psychological experience of COVID-19 patients during hospitalization could be summarized into five themes. Firstly, attitudes toward the disease included fear, denial, and stigma during the early stages, which gradually developed into acceptance in the later stages. Secondly, the major source of stress included the viral nature of the disease, quarantine measures, and concerns regarding the health of family members. Thirdly, reactions of body and mind included disease stage-dependent emotional responses, excessive attention to symptoms, rumination, and changes in diet, sleep, and behavior. Fourthly, supportive factors included psychological adjustments, medical care, and family and social support. Finally, the disease resulted in psychological growth and patients viewed problems with gratitude through the cherishing of life, family, bravery, and tenacity.","COVID-19 patients gradually changed their attitude toward the disease and displayed emotional responses dependent on the stage of the disease. Negative emotions dominated during the early stages but gradually gave way to mixed positive and negative emotions.

We aimed to share our strategy in handling neurosurgical emergencies at a remote center in Borneo Island. Our objectives included discussing the logistic and geographical challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Miri General Hospital (MGH) is a remote center in Sarawak, Malaysia, serving a population with difficult access to neurosurgical services. Two neurosurgeons were stationed here on a rotational basis every fortnight during the pandemic to handle neurosurgical cases. Patients were triaged depending on their urgent needs for surgery or transfer to a neurosurgical center and managed accordingly. All patients were screened for potential risk of contracting COVID-19 prior to the surgery. Based on this, the level of personal protective equipment required for the healthcare workers involved was determined.","During the initial six weeks of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, there were 50 urgent neurosurgical consultations. Twenty patients (40%) required emergency surgery or intervention. There were nine vascular (45%), five trauma (25%), four tumor (15%), and two infection cases (10%). Eighteen patients were operated at MGH, among whom 17 (94.4%) survived. Ninety percent of anticipated transfers were avoided. None of the medical staff acquired COVID-19.","This framework allowed timely intervention for neurosurgical emergencies (within a safe limit), minimized transfer, and enabled uninterrupted neurosurgical services at a remote center with difficult access to neurosurgical care during a pandemic."],"charNum":1690,"wordNum":245,"sentenceNum":15},{"title":"COVID-19 Infection Among Healthcare Workers in a National Healthcare System: the Qatar Experience.","content":["Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection.","The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and >28,000 employees, between March 10-June 24, 2020.
